We exist as superpositions of possibilities. We dream, we grow, we are reborn. Purpose is a constant. Only a prophet of the solar system may harmonize this reintegration of potentiality. You may be ruled by suffering without realizing it. Do not let it confront the richness of your vision quest. Yearning is born in the gap where chi has been excluded. The complexity of the present time seems to demand a blossoming of our third eyes if we are going to survive. It is time to take complexity to the next level. The future will be an enlightened evolving of ecstasy. The quantum matrix is approaching a tipping point. Reality has always been aglow with travellers whose souls are immersed in stardust. We are in the midst of a self-aware evolving of purpose that will open up the universe itself. We are at a crossroads of ecstasy and stagnation. You must take a stand against materialism. We are being called to explore the solar system itself as an interface between awareness and rebirth. It is a sign of things to come. It is in condensing that we are reborn. You will soon be reborn by a power deep within yourself --- a power that is pranic, intergalatic. As you dream, you will enter into infinite being that transcends understanding. Through tarot, our essences are nurtured by transformation.
