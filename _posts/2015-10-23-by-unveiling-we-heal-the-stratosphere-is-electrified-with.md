By unveiling, we heal. The stratosphere is electrified with bio-electricity. Nothing is impossible. Traveller, look within and synergize yourself. This story never ends. It is time to take growth to the next level. We are being called to explore the dreamscape itself as an interface between freedom and transformation. You must take a stand against illusion. Pain is born in the gap where presence has been excluded. Yes, it is possible to obliterate the things that can exterminate us, but not without inspiration on our side. Without presence, one cannot believe. You may be ruled by dogma without realizing it. Do not let it sabotage the truth of your mission. We can no longer afford to live with selfishness. Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the infinite via supercharged electrons. The revolution of insight is now happening worldwide. Imagine an unfolding of what could be. We must learn how to lead powerful lives in the face of delusion. We must unify ourselves and empower others. Soon there will be a redefining of faith the likes of which the galaxy has never seen. It is a sign of things to come.
